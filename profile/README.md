# SMEFT Dimension-8 RGEs

This repository contains the following information:

1. [Repository/Folder_name]: The one-loop renormalisation group running of the Dimension-8 bosonic Standard
Model effective operators by pairs of the leading dimension-six interactions at 1-loop.  [We put more description details as we upload the files.] This files are supplementary to the article: (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05291.pdf).

2. [Repository/Folder_name]: Green basis operators, redundancies, etc. This files are supplementary to the article: (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12724.pdf).

3. [Repository/Folder_name]: The renormalisation group running of the Dimension-8 bosonic Standard Model effective operators at 1-loop. We focus on contributions driven by one dimension-eight term and SM couplings.
